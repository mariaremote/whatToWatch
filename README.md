# What to Watch?

This project was part of [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) **Front-End Development** course on `Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests`.

## Description

You’ve caught up on your list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look. In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion.

## TODO's

-[x] Checkout the displayMovie() function in helpers.js to use the DOM to rearrange the layout of information on the page. Try displaying different types of information like cast, or release date.

-   Create a way to store a user’s liked and disliked movies and display this list on the page.
-   Our API call inside of getMovies() returns many pages of results, but currently our program only randomizes results from the first page. To randomize our results even more, update getMovies() so that movies contains results from a random page instead of the first page.

-   refactor all
